(Keep in mind that night elf characters are not able to find copper until they journey to Darkshore, a level 11+ area)<br /><br />Copper Bar's are used mainly by Engineers and Blacksmiths.<br /><br />Copper Ore's smelt into Copper Bars, which are generally very easy to sell at high rates on the auction house. As such this is one of efficient ways to make money when first starting on a new server :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mawx</b></h3>The best place to mine copper in my opinion is the Gol'Bolar Quarry in Dun Morogh. You can easily get 100 ores per hour if you are alone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zolail</b></h3>I have found these to be an easy source of income since the release of TBC and the introduction of Jewelcrafting since most people are buying the mats to power through it to cap it on there main characters.<br /><br /> I would suggest mining to any new player as a way to make money with the way most low level crafting materials are selling at the moment, I am sure this effect won't last much longer but I do hope most of you take the chance to cash in on it.</div>
